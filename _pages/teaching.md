# Teaching Experience

## STA101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference  
**Duration:** August 2023 - May 2024  
**Website:** [STA101 Course Page](https://sta101-f23.github.io/)

**Course Description:**  
An introduction to statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. The course covers themes such as data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. It emphasizes the principles underlying quantitative research in various disciplines, including social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Through research projects, students learn the process of scientific discovery, synthesis, and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Supplementary readings provide insight into the importance of statistical thinking, inspired by S. Wilks' 1950 statement: *"Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."*  

**Teaching Responsibilities:**  
- Led discussion sections and recitation sessions to reinforce lecture material.
- Assisted students in completing research projects focused on real-world data analysis.
- Provided guidance on statistical software, including R and Python, for data visualization and analysis.
- Held regular office hours to address student questions and provide individualized support.

## STA360: Bayesian Methods and Modern Statistics  
**Duration:** August 2024 - December 2024  
**Website:** [STA360 Course Page](https://sta360-fa24.github.io/)

**Course Description:**  
This course focuses on advanced statistical modeling and Bayesian data analysis. Topics include Bayesian inference, prior and posterior distributions, multi-level models, model checking and selection, and stochastic simulation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Students apply these concepts through hands-on projects and assignments designed to deepen their understanding of modern statistical methods.

**Teaching Responsibilities:**  
- Conducted lectures and tutorials on Bayesian inference and MCMC techniques.
- Designed and graded assignments involving real-world applications of Bayesian methods.
- Supported students in implementing Bayesian models using statistical tools such as RStan and PyMC3.
- Facilitated discussions on model evaluation, checking, and selection to enhance critical thinking.
