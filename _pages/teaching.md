## TA for STA101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

**Duration:** Fall 2023, Spring 2024  

**Website:** [STA101 Course Page](https://sta101-f23.github.io/)

**Professor:** [Prof. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/mine)

**Course Description:**  
An introduction to statistics as the science of understanding and analyzing data. The course emphasizes core themes such as data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling, with applications in social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Students engage in research projects to learn the process of scientific discovery, synthesis, and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Supplementary readings highlight the importance of statistical thinking, exemplified by S. Wilks' statement: "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."

## TA for STA360: Bayesian Methods and Modern Statistics

**Duration:** Fall 2024

**Website:** [STA360 Course Page](https://sta360-fa24.github.io/)

**Professor:** [Prof. Alexander Fisher](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Alexander.Fisher)

**Course Description:**  
This course explores Bayesian modeling and inference through real-world examples. Topics include Bayes' theorem, exchangeability, conjugate priors, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings, hierarchical modeling, and Bayesian regression. Students learn to compare and contrast Bayesian and frequentist methods. By the end of the course, they are expected to construct Bayesian models and use MCMC to sample from posterior distributions for inference.
