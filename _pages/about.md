<!-- My name is Minh Anh To and I'm a Master's in Statistics student at Duke.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.  -->

Hi! 

I'm Minh-Anh To, a data scientist and machine learning engineer with 3+ years of experience and a strong foundation in statistical science and AI. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Statistical Science at Duke University, supported by a full-tuition and Vingroup Scholarship.  I also serve as a teaching assistant (TA), a member of the [Graduate Consultative Committee (GCC)](https://stat.duke.edu/ms/student-governance), and an official member of [American Statistical Association (ASA)](https://www.amstat.org/).

My journey in data science has been all about tackling impactful, real-world challenges with data and AI. During my [summer internship](https://cfar.duke.edu/front-page/2024-quan-methods-summer-intern-profiles) at the Duke University School of Medicine, I led the development of a full machine-learning pipeline to optimize antibody production for HIV/AIDS patients. Currently, I’m collaborating with a [chess grandmaster](https://chessmind.ai/) as an AI developer to create a generative AI-powered Chess Tutor bot that delivers personalized post-game analysis and strategic insights.

Before coming to Duke, I worked as a research assistant at the [Vietnam Institute of Mathematics](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html), focusing on statistical inference and earning a significant research grant from VinIF Vietnam. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in [Hanoi National University of Education](https://english.hnue.edu.vn/) and spent a few years teaching university-level statistics and calculus, where I discovered my passion for helping others grow their skills.

Technically, I’m skilled in Python, R, and SQL, with experience in AI tools. My interests include predictive modeling, hierachical models, and Bayesian inference.

Outside of work, I like to recharge with board games, books, DIY projects, and yoga—or just trying to build something new!

Let’s connect and chat about data, AI, and everything in between!
