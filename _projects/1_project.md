Welcome to the **NuCLS Project**, where I delve into the integration of complex biomedical image datasets with great deep learning tools. This project focuses on leveraging Hugging Face for seamless data handling, conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying advanced deep learning techniques for detecting and classifying cell nuclei in breast cancer images. By optimizing model performance and utilizing precise evaluation metrics, I aim to contribute to improved accuracy in medical image analysis.

## Project Overview


In this project, I:

- Integrated a large, complex breast cancer image dataset with detailed nuclei annotations into Hugging Face's data management system, enabling efficient access, preprocessing, and augmentation.
  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics, including the distribution of cancerous nuclei across different hospitals.

- Implemented a YOLOv8 model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), to detect and classify cell nuclei in biomedical images.

- Developed custom training pipelines using PyTorch and Hugging Face's `datasets` and `transformers` libraries.

- Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and regularization techniques.

- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
